/// Its `deinit`, like those of `SSHPTYChannel`, `SSHStreamLocalChannel`,
/// `SSHSFTPClient` and `SSHSFTPFile`, hands remote cleanup to an unstructured
/// `Task` that nothing retains: `deinit` returns with that work still
/// outstanding, and no caller can await it. In a test process that reads as
/// flakiness rather than as failure, because the work begins whenever the last
/// reference happens to drop — so its cost can land on a later test than the
/// one whose assertions provoked it.
///
/// The cost is uneven across the five, and this `deinit` is the cheap end. It
/// invalidates the driver — no operation mutex, no deadline — and only for a
/// connection opened through a Jump Host does it also abort the forwarding
/// transport and close the parent, so a direct connection reaches no close at
/// all. The one close it can reach, `SessionDriver.close`, is cancellable, and
/// its two-second budget bounds only the native calls: the deadline is computed
/// after `acquireOperation()` returns, so the wait for the driver's operation
/// mutex ahead of it is unbounded. The four channel `deinit`s are the expensive
/// end — they take that same mutex and then run non-cancellably.
///
/// #139 is linked for its timing evidence, not as a cause — nothing here
/// establishes that these `deinit`s produce it; it records the same failure
/// moving between two adjacent tests of one suite, which is timing no single
/// test controls, and its own `deinit` hypothesis was built on
/// `SSHPTYChannel`. #136 has since stopped the four `close*` channel teardowns
/// invalidating the session when a close only ran out of time, but that
/// verdict reaches no further: `SessionDriver.close`, the close reached from
/// here, still invalidates on any failure including a bare expiry, as do the
/// two-second cleanup in `execute`'s catch and its sibling operation paths, of
/// which #149 tracks only some.
