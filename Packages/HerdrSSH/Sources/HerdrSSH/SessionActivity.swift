/// Releases the operations blocked on one libssh2 session as soon as another
/// operation has taken bytes off the socket they share.
///
/// libssh2 multiplexes every channel over a single socket and buffers whatever
/// it decrypts, so an operation reading its own channel also consumes the
/// packets the other channels are blocked on. The socket is then empty and has
/// no edge left to report: a wait armed purely on socket readiness sleeps out
/// its whole deadline on bytes that already arrived. Every wait therefore
/// captures the session's receive count before it lets another operation run,
/// and is released the moment that count moves.
///
/// Counting receives rather than signalling on every handover is what keeps
/// this from becoming a spin. An operation that retries and finds nothing
/// takes no bytes off the socket, so it wakes nobody, and the number of
/// wakeups stays bounded by the traffic that actually arrived.
